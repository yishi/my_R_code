# my_R_code

Here is a repository for my R code.

Recently, I read the book - Practical Data Science Cookbook.

So, I practice my code capacity not only in R but also in Python.

I use the automobile [**data**](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/vehicles.csv.zip) from U.S. Department of Energy to do data analysis, which is the example from the chapter 2 of the book, the R code is in this directory, the Python code is in [**here**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yishi/Data-Analysis-Series-in-Python/blob/master/Data_Analysis_Series_VI.ipynb).

I also save my R code, which is from the example of the chapter 5 of the book, mainly use the package **dplyr** and **data.table** to deal with this socalled middle size of data, which could fit the memory of our laptop computer, but maybe kill our programming time.

We always talk about big data, TB, PB, but I think we had better sharpen our skills using middle data first, such as data clean, data transformation, make prediction or classification or some other models, compare these models and choose the best, then deploy this model and to test it in the real scene.
